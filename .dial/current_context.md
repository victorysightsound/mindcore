# Task: Integrate scoring into SearchBuilder.execute() pipeline

## ⚠️ SIGNS (Critical Rules)


- **ONE TASK ONLY: Complete exactly this task. No scope creep.**

- **SEARCH BEFORE CREATE: Always search for existing files/functions before creating new ones.**

- **NO PLACEHOLDERS: Every implementation must be complete. No TODO, FIXME, or stub code.**

- **VALIDATE BEFORE DONE: Run `dial validate` after implementing. Don't mark complete without testing.**

- **RECORD LEARNINGS: After success, capture what you learned with `dial learn "..." -c category`.**

- **FAIL FAST: If blocked or confused, stop and ask rather than guessing.**



## Project Learnings (apply these patterns)


- [gotcha] Module visibility: when engine.rs references types from other modules, those modules must be pub mod not mod. Fixed store and builder visibility.

- [pattern] Mutex<Vec<Connection>> makes Database auto-Sync without unsafe impl. Connection is Send, Mutex provides Sync. No need for unsafe.
