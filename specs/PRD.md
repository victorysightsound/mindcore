# MindCore — Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-03-19
**Status:** v0.1.0 shipped

---

## 1. Vision

### 1.1 Problem

AI agent applications in Rust need persistent memory — SQLite + FTS5 + scoring + optional vector search. Each project that builds this reimplements the same primitives. The Rust ecosystem has no standalone, feature-gated agent memory crate.

### 1.2 Solution

MindCore is a standalone Rust library crate providing a pluggable, feature-gated memory engine. Consumers implement `MemoryRecord` for their types and get storage, search, decay, consolidation, and context assembly — from a 2MB FTS5-only build to a 40MB full-featured engine.

### 1.3 Success Criteria

- All tests pass with `cargo test` and `cargo test --features full`
- Any Rust project can implement `MemoryRecord` for their types and use the engine
- FTS5 search returns results in <5ms for 10K memories
- Vector search returns results in <50ms for 10K memories
- Binary size: ~2MB default, ~35-40MB full
- Zero `unsafe` outside of the candle mmap call (which is upstream)
- All public types documented with rustdoc

### 1.4 Non-Goals (v1)

- GUI or TUI interface
- Cloud sync or multi-machine replication
- Python/JS bindings (deferred)
- Belief memory type (deferred to post-v1)
- Native graph database (SQLite CTEs sufficient for v1 scale)
- LongMemEval benchmark harness (separate workspace member, post-v1)

## 2. Architecture Reference

Full architecture, traits, schemas, and search pipeline are defined in `MINDCORE_ARCHITECTURE.md`. This PRD references it rather than duplicating. Key design documents:

| Document | Contents |
|----------|----------|
| `MINDCORE_ARCHITECTURE.md` | Crate structure, traits, schema, search pipeline, API |
| `DECISIONS.md` | 22 architectural decisions with rationale |
| `MINDCORE_RESEARCH.md` | Landscape analysis, academic foundations |

## 4. Task Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (tasks 1-12):  Foundation — no dependencies
Phase 2 (tasks 13-21): Scoring — depends on Phase 1
Phase 3 (tasks 22-27): Consolidation — depends on Phase 1
Phase 4 (tasks 28-34): Activation — depends on Phase 2 (needs ScoringStrategy)
Phase 5 (tasks 35-47): Vector — depends on Phase 1
Phase 6 (tasks 48-54): Graph — depends on Phase 1
Phase 7 (tasks 55-64): Advanced — depends on Phases 2, 3, 5, 6
Phase 8 (tasks 65-73): LLM — depends on Phases 3, 5, 6, 7
Phase 9 (tasks 74-84): Polish — depends on all previous phases
```

Phases 3, 4, 5, 6 can run in parallel after Phase 2 completes (they're independent feature flags). Phase 7 unifies them. Phase 8 adds LLM features on top. Phase 9 polishes and ships.

---

## 5. Quality Gates

Each phase must pass before the next begins:

| Gate | Criteria |
|------|----------|
| **Build** | `cargo build --features <phase-flags>` succeeds with zero warnings |
| **Test** | `cargo test --features <phase-flags>` — all tests pass |
| **Clippy** | `cargo clippy --features <phase-flags> -- -D warnings` — zero warnings |
| **Doc** | `cargo doc --features <phase-flags> --no-deps` — no broken links |

---

## 6. Constraints

- **No `unsafe`** except for candle's `VarBuilder::from_mmaped_safetensors` (upstream requirement)
- **No `unwrap()`** in library code — all errors propagated via `MindCoreError`
- **No `anyhow`** — structured errors only (`thiserror`)
- **No `println!`** — all logging via `tracing`
- **No panics** — library must never panic on valid input
- **Minimum Rust 1.85** — edition 2024, native async traits
- **Feature isolation** — each feature flag must compile independently
- **Zero cost when unused** — disabled features add zero binary size and zero runtime overhead

---

## 7. Testing Strategy

| Level | Scope | Location |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Unit | Individual functions (scoring formulas, RRF merge, activation computation) | Inline `#[cfg(test)]` modules |
| Integration | Multi-component workflows (store → search → score → assemble) | `tests/` directory |
| Feature isolation | Each feature flag compiles and tests independently | CI matrix |
| Cross-feature | All features enabled simultaneously | `cargo test --features full` |
| Performance | Latency targets met (FTS5 <5ms, vector <50ms) | `benches/` with criterion |

---
