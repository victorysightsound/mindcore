## 1. Multi-Agent Orchestration Platforms

### Ruflo (formerly Claude Flow)
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/ruvnet/ruflo
- **Stars:** ~19,000+
- **Description:** The leading multi-agent orchestration platform for Claude Code. Deploys 60+ agents in coordinated swarms with shared memory, persistent workflows, and RAG across codebases.
- **Key Architecture:**
  - Orchestrator assigns tasks and monitors agents
  - Memory bank with CRDT-based shared knowledge
  - Terminal manager for shell sessions
  - Task scheduler with prioritized queues and dependency tracking
  - Self-learning neural capabilities that learn from every task execution
  - 215 MCP tools, 8 AgentDB controllers
- **PIRDLY Insight:** Ruflo's evolution from "Claude Flow" to a 250K+ line TypeScript/WASM codebase shows the scale these orchestrators can reach. Their CRDT-based shared memory and AgentDB controller patterns are relevant to PIRDLY's two-tier memory design. However, Ruflo is deeply Claude-specific — PIRDLY's multi-CLI approach (Claude, Codex, Gemini) is a differentiator. Ruflo's self-learning from task execution patterns directly parallels PIRDLY's learning/memory system.

### OpenHands
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands
- **Stars:** 65,000+
- **Description:** Open-source platform for cloud coding agents. Model-agnostic, enterprise-ready. Scale from one to thousands of agents with open SDKs, APIs, and micro-agents.
- **Key Philosophy:** Agents should be composable micro-units that can scale horizontally. Model-agnostic design lets you swap LLM backends.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** OpenHands proves the market for model-agnostic agent orchestration. Their micro-agent architecture — small, focused agents composed into larger workflows — validates PIRDLY's approach of using specialized CLI tools rather than a monolithic agent. Their enterprise-scale thinking (thousands of agents) shows where the industry is heading.

### BMAD (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development)
- **Description:** A complete framework orchestrating 12+ specialized AI agents for different roles — Product Manager, Architect, Scrum Master, Developer, QA.
- **Key Philosophy:** Model the software development lifecycle as a team of role-specific agents, each with its own persona and toolset.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** BMAD's role-based agent design is interesting but may be over-engineered for PIRDLY's use case. However, the concept of specialized personas for different phases (discovery, planning, execution) aligns with PIRDLY's phase-based approach. The key takeaway: don't just orchestrate code generation — orchestrate the entire SDLC.

### Claude Squad
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/smtilson/claude-squad
- **Description:** Terminal app that multiplexes Claude Code instances — spawn multiple agents working concurrently in separate tmux panes, each on a different task.
- **Key Philosophy:** Simple multiplexing over complex orchestration. Let each agent work independently with minimal coordination overhead.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** Claude Squad is the simplest possible multi-agent approach — just parallel tmux sessions. PIRDLY adds structured coordination, memory, and verification on top of this basic pattern. Claude Squad validates that developers want multi-instance workflows but shows the gap: no shared memory, no learning, no structured planning.

### Gas Town (Steve Yegge) & OpenClaw (Peter Steinberger)
- **Description:** Multi-agent orchestration systems for Claude Code with persistent work tracking. Made "AI agent orchestrators" feel mainstream.
- **Key Architecture:** Under the hood: LLM API call + state loop + tools + memory + orchestration — a small set of primitives wired together.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** The core insight that agent orchestrators are fundamentally simple primitives composed together validates PIRDLY's architecture. The differentiator is how well you compose them, not how complex you make them.

### Continuous-Claude-v2
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/parcadei/Continuous-Claude-v2
- **Description:** Context management for Claude Code. Hooks maintain state via ledgers and handoffs. MCP execution without context pollution. Agent orchestration with isolated context windows.
- **Key Pattern:** Agents spawn with fresh context for complex tasks that would degrade in a compacted context. They return a summary and optionally create handoffs.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** Directly implements the "fresh context window" pattern that PIRDLY's research on Ralph Loop identified. The ledger/handoff system for state persistence between fresh contexts is exactly what PIRDLY's file-based state management achieves. Worth studying their hook-based approach vs. PIRDLY's external orchestration.

### ComposioHQ Agent Orchestrator
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/ComposioHQ/agent-orchestrator
- **Description:** Manages fleets of AI coding agents in parallel. Each agent gets its own git worktree, branch, and PR. Agent-agnostic (Claude Code, Codex, Aider), runtime-agnostic (tmux, Docker), tracker-agnostic (GitHub, Linear). Has 8 swappable plugin slots.
- **Key Architecture:** Plugin-based with swappable slots for agent runtimes, SCM platforms, and task trackers.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** Their plugin architecture for swapping agent runtimes, SCM platforms, and task trackers is a strong pattern. PIRDLY's CLI profile system maps well to this. The multi-tool agnosticism (Claude, Codex, Aider) validates PIRDLY's multi-CLI approach.

### Overstory
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/jayminwest/overstory
- **Description:** Multi-agent orchestration via git worktrees and tmux. Coordinates agents through a custom SQLite mail system. Pluggable `AgentRuntime` interface supports Claude Code, Pi, Gemini CLI.
- **Key Innovation:** SQLite-based inter-agent messaging system for coordination between isolated agent sessions.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** The SQLite-based inter-agent messaging is clever — agents communicate through database records rather than shared memory. Also explicitly warns about compounding error rates in agent swarms, a useful caution for PIRDLY's orchestrator design.

## 2. AI Agent Memory & Context Systems

### MemOS (Memory Operating System)
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/MemTensor/MemOS
- **Description:** A Memory Operating System for LLMs and AI agents. Unifies store/retrieve/manage for long-term memory with context-aware interactions.
- **Key Architecture:**
  - Unified Memory API (add, retrieve, edit, delete)
  - Memory structured as an inspectable, editable graph
  - Multi-modal memory (text, images, tool traces, personas)
  - Local plugin with on-device SQLite, hybrid search (FTS5 + vector)
  - Task summarization and skill evolution
- **PIRDLY Insight:** MemOS's use of SQLite with FTS5 + vector hybrid search directly validates PIRDLY's decision to start with FTS5 and add embeddings later. Their "skill evolution" concept — agents learning reusable patterns from completed tasks — maps to PIRDLY's learnings system. The graph-structured memory is more sophisticated than PIRDLY's current flat design and could be a future enhancement.

### MemoRAG
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/qhjqhj00/MemoRAG
- **Description:** RAG framework built on a super-long memory model. Achieves global understanding of entire databases by recalling query-specific clues from memory. Accepted at TheWebConf 2025.
- **Key Innovation:** Instead of standard RAG (query → retrieve → answer), MemoRAG builds a global memory model first, then uses it to generate better retrieval clues.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** MemoRAG's two-phase approach (build global understanding, then targeted retrieval) is relevant to PIRDLY's project discovery phase. After discovery, PIRDLY could build a holistic project model that improves subsequent context injection quality rather than just doing keyword-based FTS5 lookups.

### memU
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/NevaMind-AI/memU
- **Description:** Memory framework for 24/7 proactive agents. Reduces LLM token cost for always-on agents. Continuously captures user intent — agents can anticipate what you're about to do.
- **Key Philosophy:** Memory should enable proactive agent behavior, not just reactive recall. Agents should understand ongoing user intent.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** PIRDLY's learning system is reactive (store what happened, recall when relevant). memU's proactive intent detection could inspire PIRDLY to analyze patterns of what users typically need next in a project phase and pre-fetch relevant context.

### LightRAG
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG
- **Stars:** Large (EMNLP 2025 paper)
- **Description:** Simple and fast RAG with knowledge graph management. Supports creating, editing, and deleting entities and relationships. Comes with Web UI and API.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** LightRAG's knowledge graph approach could enhance PIRDLY's memory system — instead of flat learnings, structure them as a graph of concepts, errors, patterns, and relationships. Their "simple and fast" philosophy aligns with PIRDLY's pragmatic FTS5-first approach.

### OMEGA Memory
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/omega-memory/core
- **Description:** Persistent memory for AI coding agents via MCP server with 25 tools. Ranked #1 on LongMemEval (95.4%). Stores decisions, lessons, error patterns with semantic search. SQLite + CPU-only ONNX embeddings, fully local. Features memory decay, graph relationships, and encryption at rest.
- **Key Innovation:** "Forgetting intelligence" — memory decay with exemptions for error patterns. ~8ms embedding time and <50ms query latency set a performance benchmark.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** Architecture is remarkably close to PIRDLY's memory design — SQLite-backed, local-first, with error pattern tracking and cross-session learning. The memory decay concept (less-used learnings fade while validated patterns persist) is something PIRDLY should consider. The performance benchmarks (<50ms queries) set a target.

### Mem0
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0
- **Stars:** ~37,000+
- **Description:** The most popular open-source memory layer for LLM applications. Provides persistent, contextual memory that evolves with each user interaction.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** The most popular project in this space. Its cloud-dependent model contrasts with PIRDLY's local-first approach, but its API design for memory storage/retrieval is worth studying as a reference for ergonomic memory interfaces.

### Engram
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/engram
- **Description:** Persistent memory system for AI coding agents. Agent-agnostic Go binary with SQLite + FTS5, MCP server, HTTP API, CLI, and TUI.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** Technically very close to PIRDLY's planned memory system (SQLite + FTS5, CLI interface, agent-agnostic). Written in Go, but the feature set overlap is significant — a direct competitor in the memory space. PIRDLY's Rust implementation and two-tier global/project split are differentiators.

### Agent Memory Paper List
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/Shichun-Liu/Agent-Memory-Paper-List
- **Description:** Curated academic survey distinguishing Agent Memory from RAG and Context Engineering. Covers memory forms, functions, and dynamics.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** Useful reference for understanding the theoretical landscape. The distinction between memory forms (episodic, semantic, procedural) could help PIRDLY categorize its learnings more effectively — e.g., "error patterns" are procedural memory, "project context" is semantic, "session history" is episodic.

---

## 3. Task Planning & Execution Frameworks

### Claude Task Master
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master
- **Description:** Task management system for AI-driven development. Without task structure, Claude tries to solve everything at once and loses the thread. With TaskMaster, the agent works on one clearly defined task at a time. Reports ~90% fewer errors.
- **Key Philosophy:** Structured task decomposition prevents context thrashing. One task at a time with clear boundaries.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** Validates PIRDLY's task-by-task execution approach. The 90% error reduction stat is a strong signal that structured task management is essential. PIRDLY's acceptance criteria verification before task completion adds an extra layer that Task Master doesn't have.

### Claude Task Manager
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/vibehat/claude-task-manager
- **Description:** AI agent orchestration coordinating multiple AI models across workflows, with personal project memory so agents never forget decisions, context, or progress. Integrates with Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code.
- **Key Innovation:** Built on Claude Task Master as a core engine but adds cross-tool orchestration and persistent project memory.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** Shows the natural evolution from task management to full orchestration with memory — exactly PIRDLY's trajectory. Their multi-tool integration (Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code) parallels PIRDLY's multi-CLI profile system.

### GitHub Copilot Coding Agent
- **Description:** GitHub's autonomous coding agent. Assign a GitHub issue to Copilot, and it spins up an ephemeral dev environment, checks out the repo, creates a branch, codes, runs tests/linters, and opens a PR.
- **Key Philosophy:** Ephemeral, isolated environments per task. Full CI/CD integration. Issue-driven workflow.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** Copilot's ephemeral environment pattern parallels PIRDLY's researched worktree-per-task isolation from Auto-Claude. The issue-driven workflow is a different entry point than PIRDLY's discovery-based approach but could be supported as a project type.

### Plandex
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/plandex-ai/plandex
- **Stars:** ~15,000
- **Description:** Terminal-based AI coding agent for large projects. Plans and executes multi-step tasks across dozens of files. Features a diff review sandbox, version control for plans, automated debugging, and configurable autonomy (full auto to fine-grained control). Written in Go.
- **Key Innovation:** Plan versioning with branches — explore alternative approaches without losing previous plans. Diff review sandbox keeps AI changes separate until approved.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** Plandex's plan branching is excellent — PIRDLY could adopt the idea of versioned plans to explore alternatives. The diff sandbox (staging AI changes for review before applying) is a strong UX pattern. Their chat-to-tell mode transition mirrors PIRDLY's discovery-to-execution flow.

### MetaGPT
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/FoundationAgents/MetaGPT
- **Stars:** ~50,000+
- **Description:** Multi-agent framework where "Code = SOP(Team)". Assigns roles (product manager, architect, engineer) to GPTs. Returns PRD, Design, Tasks, or Repo from a one-line requirement.
- **Key Philosophy:** Standard operating procedures (SOPs) drive agent coordination — formalize how agents interact rather than letting them figure it out.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** MetaGPT's SOP-driven approach is the most mature "idea to code" pipeline. Their role-based agent specialization could inform PIRDLY's planning phase. The one-line-requirement-to-repo pipeline is the ultimate simplification of what PIRDLY aims to do.

### Devika
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/stitionai/devika
- **Stars:** ~18,000+
- **Description:** Open-source autonomous software engineer (Devin alternative). Breaks down high-level instructions into steps, researches information, and writes code. Supports Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Mistral, and local LLMs.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** Devika uses direct API calls while PIRDLY uses external CLI orchestration — a fundamental architectural difference. PIRDLY's zero-token orchestration overhead is a structural advantage. However, Devika's dynamic agent state tracking and step decomposition UX are worth studying.

### Agentic Project Management (APM)
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/sdi2200262/agentic-project-management
- **Description:** AI workflow framework bringing project management principles to AI-assisted workflows. Follows: Setup Phase (Discovery & Planning) → Task Loop Phase (Plan Execution). Supports Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** The discovery-then-task-loop architecture is essentially PIRDLY's planned workflow. Their approach to context retention across long sessions addresses the same problem PIRDLY's memory system targets.

### GitHub Spec Kit
- **Description:** GitHub's open-source toolkit for spec-driven development. Start with a spec (contract), then use AI agents (Copilot, Claude Code, Gemini CLI) to generate, test, and validate code against it.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** Spec-driven development is conceptually similar to PIRDLY's PRD-based planning. The idea that the spec is the source of truth that agents validate against reinforces PIRDLY's acceptance criteria verification pattern.

## 4. Rust AI Agent Frameworks

### AutoAgents (Liquidos AI)
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/liquidos-ai/AutoAgents
- **Description:** Modular multi-agent framework in Rust. Type-safe agent model with structured tool calling, configurable memory, and pluggable LLM backends. Built on Ractor (actor framework).
- **Key Architecture:**
  - Actor-based agent model (via Ractor)
  - Type-safe tool calling
  - Configurable memory per agent
  - Pluggable LLM backends
  - WASM support for browser deployment
- **PIRDLY Insight:** Most directly relevant Rust framework. The actor model (Ractor) for agent management is worth evaluating — it provides natural isolation, message passing, and supervision trees. PIRDLY could benefit from an actor-based architecture for managing concurrent CLI tool executions. Their type-safe tool calling pattern aligns with PIRDLY's Rust philosophy.

### Kowalski
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/yarenty/kowalski
- **Description:** Rust-native agentic AI framework. Zero Python dependencies, compiles to standalone binaries. Federation crate enables lightweight multi-agent workflows — pipeline automations, task delegation, agent-to-agent communication.
- **Key Philosophy:** Pure Rust, no Python dependency, modular submodules (federation, orchestration, pipelines).
- **PIRDLY Insight:** Kowalski's zero-Python philosophy matches PIRDLY's pure-Rust approach. Their federation crate concept — a dedicated module for multi-agent coordination — could inform PIRDLY's crate structure. The pipeline automation pattern is relevant to PIRDLY's phase-based execution.

### rs-agent (Lattice AI)
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/Protocol-Lattice/rs-agent
- **Description:** Production-ready Rust agent orchestrator. Pluggable LLMs, tool calling (UTCP), retrieval-capable memory, CodeMode execution, multi-agent coordination. Feature-flagged adapters for Gemini, Ollama, Anthropic, OpenAI.
- **Key Innovation:** Feature-flagged LLM adapters behind a common trait — compile with only the backends you need.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** rs-agent's feature-flag approach for LLM backends is elegant — PIRDLY could use similar feature flags for CLI tool support (claude, codex, gemini). Their common LLM trait design is a good pattern for PIRDLY's executor profiles.

### AutoGPT (Rust)
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/kevin-rs/autogpt
- **Description:** Pure Rust framework for building AGI. 8 built-in specialized autonomous agents. No-code agent configs via declarative YAML.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** The YAML-based agent configuration is interesting for PIRDLY's CLI profile system — letting users define custom tool profiles declaratively rather than through code.

### Anda Framework
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/ldclabs/anda
- **Description:** Rust AI agent framework for decentralized, autonomous agents with perpetual memory. Built for ICP and TEEs.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** While the decentralized/TEE aspects aren't relevant, Anda's "perpetually memorizing" design philosophy aligns with PIRDLY's persistent learning system. Their approach to agent autonomy — agents that can operate independently with their own memory — mirrors PIRDLY's goal of autonomous project execution.

### Rig
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/0xPlaygrounds/rig
- **Stars:** ~1,700+
- **Description:** The leading Rust framework for building LLM-powered applications. Modular abstractions over LLM providers and vector stores. Growing ecosystem including terminal coding agents.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** The most mature Rust LLM library. PIRDLY might use it for any direct LLM integration (e.g., plan generation), though PIRDLY's external orchestration model may not need it. Worth knowing as a dependency option.

### graniet/llm
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/graniet/llm
- **Description:** Rust library and CLI to unify multiple LLM backends (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Ollama) with a single API. Supports reactive agents that cooperate via shared memory.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** The unified API across multiple LLM providers and shared-memory agent cooperation model are relevant. Could serve as a reference for PIRDLY's CLI profile abstraction layer.

### Swarm (fcn06)
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/fcn06/swarm
- **Description:** Rust SDK for building agent networks using MCP and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocols. Can execute predefined plans or generate them dynamically.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** Built around open standards (MCP, A2A) for interoperability. PIRDLY's planned MCP server could benefit from studying this project's protocol implementation.

### rs-graph-llm
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/a-agmon/rs-graph-llm
- **Description:** High-performance framework for multi-agent workflow systems in Rust. LangGraph-inspired but Rust-native, using Rig for LLM integration.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** Graph-based workflow execution could inform PIRDLY's task dependency management in the orchestrator phase.

---

## 5. Context Management & Session Patterns

### The Fresh Context Pattern (Industry-Wide)
Multiple projects and workflows now explicitly manage context window degradation:
- **Ralph Loop:** External controller restarts sessions to get fresh context windows
- **GSD:** Sub-agents with fresh context to avoid accumulation
- **Continuous-Claude-v2:** Hook-based ledger system for context handoffs
- **Ruflo:** Real-time memory management that archives, optimizes, and restores context

**PIRDLY Insight:** Fresh context management is now a recognized industry pattern. PIRDLY's external orchestration approach (spawning CLI processes) gives it natural context freshness — each CLI invocation gets a fresh window. This is a structural advantage over in-process orchestrators that must manage context manually.

### Orchestration Topology Patterns
Documented patterns from Claude Code's agent teams and community projects:

| Pattern | Description | PIRDLY Relevance |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Leader-Worker** | One orchestrator, multiple specialists | PIRDLY's primary model |
| **Task Pool** | Workers self-assign from queue | Could work for parallel task phases |
| **Pipeline** | Sequential processing with handoffs | Maps to PIRDLY's phase transitions |
| **Consensus** | Multiple agents propose, leader picks best | Useful for plan generation |
| **Worker-Watcher** | Worker does task, watcher monitors for safety | Maps to PIRDLY's verification step |

### VoltAgent
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent
- **Description:** Open-source TypeScript AI agent engineering platform. Memory adapters for cross-run persistence. Retriever agents for RAG grounding. Guardrails, workflows, MCP, voice support.
- **PIRDLY Insight:** VoltAgent's "memory adapter" pattern — pluggable storage backends for agent memory — is a clean abstraction PIRDLY could adopt. Their guardrails concept (validation before agent actions) parallels PIRDLY's acceptance criteria verification.

---

## 6. Key Design Insights for PIRDLY

### What the Landscape Validates

1. **External orchestration is the right approach.** Projects like Ralph Loop, GSD, and Continuous-Claude-v2 all converge on the pattern of external control with fresh context windows — exactly what PIRDLY does by spawning CLI processes.

2. **Persistent memory is a differentiator.** Most orchestrators (Claude Squad, basic multi-agent setups) lack cross-session learning. PIRDLY's two-tier memory system (global + project) is more sophisticated than most competitors.

3. **FTS5 is a valid starting point.** MemOS uses SQLite FTS5 + vector hybrid search, validating PIRDLY's decision to start with FTS5 and add embeddings later.

4. **Task-by-task execution prevents errors.** Claude Task Master's 90% error reduction with structured task management confirms PIRDLY's approach.

5. **Multi-CLI support is a gap in the market.** Most orchestrators are Claude-specific (Ruflo, Claude Squad) or model-agnostic at the API level (OpenHands). PIRDLY's approach of orchestrating CLI tools (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI) is unique.

### What PIRDLY Could Learn

1. **Actor-based architecture** (from AutoAgents/Ractor): Consider using Rust actors for managing concurrent CLI executions — provides natural isolation, supervision, and message passing.

2. **Knowledge graph memory** (from LightRAG, MemOS): Structure learnings as a graph of concepts, errors, and relationships rather than flat records. This enables richer queries and pattern discovery.

3. **Proactive memory** (from memU): Don't just recall on demand — analyze patterns to anticipate what context will be needed next in a given project phase.

4. **CRDT-based shared state** (from Ruflo): For future multi-agent parallelism, CRDTs enable conflict-free state merging without coordination overhead.

5. **Feature-flagged backends** (from rs-agent): Use Rust feature flags for CLI tool support — compile with only the backends you need.

6. **YAML-based profiles** (from AutoGPT Rust): Let users define custom CLI tool profiles declaratively.

7. **Skill evolution** (from MemOS): Track not just what was learned but how learnings evolve over time — a learning that's been validated 10 times is more reliable than one seen once.

8. **Worker-Watcher pattern** (from Claude Code teams): PIRDLY's verification step could be formalized as a separate watcher agent that monitors task execution for quality and safety.

9. **Memory decay** (from OMEGA Memory): Implement "forgetting intelligence" — learnings that haven't been accessed or validated decay over time, while frequently-confirmed error patterns are preserved. Prevents memory bloat.

10. **Plan versioning/branching** (from Plandex): Allow users to branch plans and explore alternative approaches without losing previous iterations. Version control for the plan itself, not just the code.

11. **SOP-driven coordination** (from MetaGPT): Formalize agent interaction patterns as standard operating procedures rather than ad-hoc coordination. Makes orchestration predictable and debuggable.

12. **SQLite inter-agent messaging** (from Overstory): Use SQLite as a message bus between isolated agent sessions — fits naturally with PIRDLY's existing SQLite-based architecture.

### What PIRDLY Already Does Better

1. **Start-to-finish journey:** Most orchestrators focus on execution only. PIRDLY covers idea → discovery → plan → execution → completion.

2. **Zero-token orchestration overhead:** External CLI orchestration costs zero LLM tokens for coordination, unlike in-process orchestrators.

3. **Multi-CLI agnosticism:** Supporting Claude, Codex, and Gemini CLIs through profiles is unique in the landscape.

4. **Two-tier memory with error classification:** Separating global patterns from project-specific context, with transient/quota/permanent error categorization, is more sophisticated than competitors.

5. **Verification before completion:** The acceptance criteria check before marking tasks complete is a quality gate most orchestrators lack.
